The method is almost same as copy conditions/interactions/attributes.(refer to 01-2, 02-2, 07-2). The difference is we copying array of global class id. Let see the

You wiill notice that there is an object "_cssGlobalClasses" with all the global classes id in array that applied on this element. This is the only thing we need to 
copy.
