The method almost same as copy conditions/attributes(refer back to 01-2, 02-2). Just that this interactions object can be in global class or element(ID) itself. So when
the time of copy interactions, if there is active class and the interactions is assign to class, then when you paste to another element, it will only add class id to 
that element. If the interactions is assgin to element and not class, then it works like copy conditions/attributes.
